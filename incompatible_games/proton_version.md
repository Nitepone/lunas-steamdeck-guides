# Changing Proton Version [Easy]

Steam automatically uses the latest proton version to launch games. It is very easy to set a proton version for Steam to use when launching a specific game. This can be useful if reviews of a game suggest using a specific version.

## Process

1. Go to the installed game in your Steam library
2. Press the settings Gear icon
3. Go to "properties"
4. Go to "compatibility"
5. Check the box that says "Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool
6. Select the desired version of Proton in the newly appeared dropdown menu

And that's it! Back out of the menu. The next time you run the game it should download (if needed) and use the version of Proton that you selected!
