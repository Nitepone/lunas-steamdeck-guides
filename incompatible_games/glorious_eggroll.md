# Proton "Glorious Eggroll" [Medium]

Proton Glorious Eggroll is a custom fork of Proton that may work better with some games. [You can look at it on Github here](https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom).

Installation must be done in desktop mode, but usage is done like any other proton version.

We will install both "Proton-GE" and "ProtonUp". ProtonUp is a great gui tool for installing custom version of Proton.

## Installation Part 1 (ProtonUp-Qt)

1. Go to the power menu and click "switch to desktop"
2. Open the "Discover" store and package manager
3. Search "ProtonUp-Qt" and install it
4. Open ProtonUp and ensure it finds your Steam installation

You should now be able to open ProtonUp from the start menu at any time.

## Installation Part 2 (Proton "Glorious Eggroll")

1. Open "ProtonUp-Qt"
2. Click "Add Version"
3. On the dialog box the "Compatibility Tool", "Proton-GE"; and the version that you want (likely latest).
4. Click "Install"
5. Wait for ProtonUp to install the new Proton version

Once done, you may return to gaming mode.

## Usage

Switching a game to a custom Proton version like Glorious Eggroll is identical to [switching to official Proton versions](./proton_version.md).
