# ProtonDB

ProtonDB is a powerful site that rates compatibility of games for Proton, and allows users to submit feedback as to how they got games to run.

Ratings for each game are provided using medals from "platinum" to "bronze". Or alternatively "borked" for games that do not work. They primarily focus on difficulty to make the game run, and secondarily focus on performance during runtime. These ratings are not 100% accurate; often relying on incomplete data.

> ## Luna Note on "Incomplete Data"
>
> Incomplete data is something that impacts ratings and reviews. While Proton is an amazing tool, it is important to know that it is reliant on community feedback, and not perfect. Often, reviews and ratings may be misleading.
>
> Specifically, watch out for old reviews. Since proton and games can recieve updates, it is possible that a configuration from 6 months ago might not work today. As of writing, the game IL-2 has a "Gold" rating, but was borked several months ago by an update.
>
> Additionally, be careful with less popular games that may not have many reviews, or people sinking playtime into testing the game.

Reviews are created by users and provide the following:
- A thumbs up or down recommendation
- System info (And a special deck icon for deck users)
- Proton version
- User commentary about "Tinker Steps" about making the game run
- User commentary on multiplayer (Often broken due to anticheat)
- User commentary, miscellanious

For making games run, we will be primarily interested in "Proton Version" and "Tinker Steps" from reviews that claim to have gotten the game to work. However, it is good to read a few reviews to get an understanding of unexpected pitfalls.
