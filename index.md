# Luna's Steamdeck Guides

This site houses a collection of small guides that I feel could have made my life easier while tinkering with my steamdeck.

All guides weill be rated to their corresponding difficulty "easy", "medium", or "hard". With the distinctions that **easy** guides are anything that does _not_ require desktop mode or significant typing, and **hard** guides require moderate use of command line.
