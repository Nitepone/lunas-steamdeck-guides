# Launch Options [Easy]

Launch options are a series of options that can change behavior of Proton and/or the game. They can be easily changed from the Steam UI.

## Process

1. Go to the installed game in your Steam library
2. Press the settings Gear icon
3. Go to "properties"
4. Go to "general"
5. Enter the desired launch options into the "launch options" field
  a. Note: Launch options are often case sensitive and picky about whitespace

Exiting out of the properties menu will save your settings and they will be applied the next time you launch the game.
